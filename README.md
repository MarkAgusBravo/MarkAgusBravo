<h1>Hey there, I'm <a  href="[https://github.com/MarkAgusBravo/]">Marko Bravo </a> <img  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px"></h1>


I'm a second year CSE undergraduate pursuing B.Tech and a passionate programmer who loves to code. I am creatively curious and a self learner. I love exploring new technologies and currently learning new skills. <br>


- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on **Android Development** and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms** everyday.
- 💬 I’m looking forward to contribute to **Open Source Projects**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: There are 10 types of people in this world those who understand binary and those who don't :)
- Show ❤ by giving⭐to my Repositories, at least your star could make someone's day 😄.
